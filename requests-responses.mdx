title: "Requests and Responses"
---

This is a full-featured RESTful API. All requests use the base URL of https://api.deepreel.com/.

Responses to each request are provided as a JSON object. The response is either the data requested, or a valid error
message and error code as outlined below.

Here is a list of all the error codes the DeepReel API returns in case something does not go as expected:

| Error Code | Meaning                                                                                                               |
