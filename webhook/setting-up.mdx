title: "Consume Webhook Events"
---

In this tutorial, we will construct a straightforward endpoint using Python and Flask, followed by making this local webhook endpoint
accessible on the internet. Next, we will link it to DeepReel webhook events, allowing us to begin gathering events at our endpoint.
Let's get started!

## Let's Start Building Your Endpoint

We'll start by creating a basic endpoint application using Python and Flask. Ensure you have the Flask library installed on your system.
You can install it using the following command:

```bash Bash
pip install Flask
```

Next, set up your 'webhook_event_listener' endpoint. We'll configure it to accept POST requests, as DeepReel will send POST requests to your endpoint.

```python
from flask import Flask, request

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/webhook_event_listener", methods=["POST"])
def webhook_event_listener():
    """
    Processes POST requests at the '/webhook_event_listener' endpoint.
    """
    print(request.json)
    return "Success!", 200

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

After creating this Python file, save it and run your Flask application using the following command:

```bash Bash
python app.py
```

Now, your local endpoint is operational. When a POST request is sent to 127.0.0.1:5000/webhook_event_listener with a JSON body,
you will be able to see the output displayed in your console.

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl --request POST
--url 'http://127.0.0.1:5000/webhook_event_listener'
--header 'Content-Type: application/json'
--data '{"msg": "Hello!"}'
```

```python Output (Python)
127.0.0.1 - "POST /webhook_event_listener HTTP/1.1" 200 -
{'msg': 'Hello!'}
```

</CodeGroup>

It's functioning successfully locally, but to receive requests from DeepReel at our endpoint in later stages, we need to expose it to the internet.

## Exposing Your Endpoint to the Internet

In a development environment, your Flask application typically runs on localhost, which isn't accessible from the internet. To receive webhooks from external sources, tools like Ngrok, LocalTunnel, Cloudflare Tunnel, or Smee.io can be used to make your local server internet-accessible.

For our needs, we'll use Smee.io, as it is free and provides a stable endpoint address. This is beneficial since we will be registering our endpoint with DeepReel.

```bash Bash
npm install -g smee-client
```

Now, visit https://smee.io/new to acquire a new endpoint address. After that, you can use the following command to make your local endpoint accessible:

```bash Bash
smee -t http://127.0.0.1:5000/webhook_event_listener -u https://smee.io/<id>
```

That's all there is to it. With this setup, your local endpoint is now capable of receiving requests from anywhere on the internet.

## Register Endpoint to DeepReel

To finalize the integration, you need to register your webhook endpoint with DeepReel. Here are the steps to follow:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Request
curl --request POST
--url 'https://api.deepreel.com/user/webhook/' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--header 'x-api-key: <your-api-key>' \
--data '{
  "endpoint": "https://smee.io/<id>",
  "events": ["video.generation.success"]
}'
```

```javascript Response (Success)
{
  "endpoint": "https://smee.io/<id>",
  "key": "<secret>"
  "events": ["video.generation.success"]
}
```

</CodeGroup>

Make sure to record the details returned from this request, as they will be essential for securing your endpoint.

## Finalizing Your Code

To finalize the implementation, it's crucial to enhance your endpoint's security by verifying DeepReel's requests using the secret key provided.

Upon successful request reception, we will display the event type and event data that DeepReel has sent to our endpoint.

<CodeGroup>

```python Python
from flask import Flask, request
import hmac
from hashlib import sha256

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/webhook_event_listener", methods=["POST"])
def webhook_event_listener():
    # Secret key received from DeepReel for verifying the request
    wh_secret = "<secret>"

    # Extracting the content of the request
    content_str = (request.data or b"").decode()

    # Extracting the signature from the request headers
    signature = request.headers.get("signature", "")

    # Calculating the HMAC of the content with the secret key
    mac = hmac.new(
        wh_secret.encode("utf-8"),
        msg=content_str.encode("utf-8"),
        digestmod=sha256,
    )
    computed_signature = mac.hexdigest()

    # Checking if the computed signature matches the received signature
    if computed_signature != signature:
        raise Exception("Invalid request")

    # Processing the event data from the request JSON
    req_json = request.json
    event_type = req_json.get('type')
    event_error = req_json.get('error')
    event_data = req_json.get('data')

    # Printing event information
    if event_error is None:
      print(f"Event Type: {event_type}; Event Data: {event_data}")
    else:
      print(f"Event Type: {event_type}; Event Error: {event_error}")

    return "Success!", 200

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(debug=True)
```

</CodeGroup>

Now, you are equipped to handle webhook events from DeepReel and open up a realm of opportunities for your application. Congratulations on successfully completing this integration journey!
