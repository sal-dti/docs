Your account plan tier will limit the overall number of requests you can make per minute. Current rate limits by plan tier are:

| Plan Tier            | Calls per minute |
| -------------------- | ---------------- |
| Starter              | 10               |
| Creator/Creator-Plus | 50               |
| Pro                  | 100              |
| Business             | 300              |
| Enterprise           | Unlimited        |

## Rate Limit Headers

Each external API call will include headers with rate limit information.
This is a convenient way to retrieve your rate limits and usage.
Every API call will respond with the following headers:

| Header                      | Description                             |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| X-Ratelimit-Limit           | Number of requests allowed per minute   |
| X-Ratelimit-Limit-Remaining | Number of requests remaining            |
| X-Ratelimit-Limit-Reset     | Time in seconds before the limit resets |
