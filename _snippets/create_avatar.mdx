[See detailed API reference](/api-reference/video/create-video)

Our Avatar training expects two videos to be recorded as per the guidelines mentioned in [this document](https://deepreel.notion.site/Create-Your-Own-DeepReel-Avatar-2ef80e263deb4d84a1733cbb9ca00eab).

Once you have the videos ready, follow the steps below:

### Step 1: Generate Signed URL

To upload the avatar videos, you need to generate a `signed URL` for each video using the following endpoint:

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash Request
    curl --request GET \
    --url https://api.deepreel.com/project/generate_signed_url/ \
    --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>'
    ```

    ```javascript Response
    {
    "filename": "<string>",
    "url": "<string>"
    }
    ```

</CodeGroup>

Save the `filename` and `url` obtained in the response for next steps.

### Step 2: Upload to URL

After obtaining the `url` for each video, upload each video to their respective `url` using a `PUT` method:

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash Request
    curl --location --request PUT '<url>' \
    --header 'Content-Type: <content-type>' \
    --data '<LOCAL_FILE_PATH>'
     ```

    ```javascript Response
    {
    }
    ```
</CodeGroup>

_Supported content-type: video/mp4_

### Step 3: Create Avatar

If both videos are successfully uploaded to their respective `url`,
pass both the generated `filename` received in response of **Step 1** to the following endpoint to create the avatar:

<CodeGroup>

    ```bash Request
    curl --request POST \
    --url https://api.deepreel.com/project/assets/generate_avatar_from_video/ \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --header 'X-API-KEY: <api-key>' \
    --data '{
    "video_1": "<string>",
    "video_2": "<string>"
    }'
     ```

    ```javascript Response
    {
    "avatar_id": "3c90c3cc-0d44-4b50-8888-8dd25736052a"
    }
    ```
</CodeGroup>
