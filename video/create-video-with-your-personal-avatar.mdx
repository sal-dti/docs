  <Step title="Create a Projcet (Skip if already exists)">
    [Create Project](/api-reference/project/create-project)

    First we will create a project and store the `project_id`.
    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Request
    curl --request POST
    --url https://api.deepreel.com/project/
    --header 'X-API-KEY: <x-api-key>'
    --data '{ 'todo' }'
    ```

    ```javascript Response
    {
      "todo": "todo"
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>

  <Step title="Get List of Languages and Avatars">
    To create an avatar video, selecting an avatar and a launguage is essential. You
    can retrieve a list of available avatars and langugages by utilizing the [List
    Avatar](/api-reference/avatar/list-avatars) and [List
    Languages](/api-reference/language/list-languages) API endpoints.

    [List Avatars](/api-reference/avatar/list-avatars)

    Employ this API to access a list of available avatars, which includes your instant avatars.
    This API request will present you with available avatar. Select one from the list and make a note of its 'avatar_id' for subsequent steps.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Request
    curl --request GET
    --url https://api.deepreel.com/project/assets/avatar/
    --header 'X-API-KEY: <x-api-key>'
    ```

    ```javascript Response
    {
      "todo": "todo"
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    [List Avatar Languages](/api-reference/language/list-languages)
    Employ this API to access a list of language supported by the selected avatar.

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Request
    curl --request GET
    --url https://api.deepreel.com/project/assets/language/avatar_id=<selected_avatar_id>
    --header 'X-API-KEY: <x-api-key>'
    ```

    ```javascript Response
    {
      "todo": "todo"
    }
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

    Assuming you've selected an avatar and a language, let's proceed to create a script and generate your video.
